1. Open [Claude](https://claude.ai) or your Claude interface
2. Paste the complete prompt into the chat
3. Claude's large context window handles long prompts exceptionally well

2. Paste the prompt into the chat box

### Prompt Structure

Each prompt file in this library includes:

```
CATEGORY: [Type of prompt]
PURPOSE: [What it does]
VARIABLES: [Required placeholders]
TONE: [Voice and style characteristics]

[Prompt instructions and content]

EXAMPLE USAGE:
[Sample input and output]
```

### Best Practices for Variable Substitution

1. **Replace all placeholders** – Look for variables in curly braces: `{variable_name}`
2. **Be specific** – Vague inputs lead to vague outputs
3. **Maintain consistency** – If a variable appears multiple times, use the same value throughout
4. **Test first** – Try with sample data before using real information
5. **Iterate** – Refine outputs by adjusting your input variables

**Example:**
```
Original: "Hi {name}, I noticed {personalized_fact}..."
Your input: "Hi Sarah, I noticed you just launched a podcast on startup culture..."
```

### Customization Tips

- **Adjust tone**: Modify phrases like "friendly" to "formal" or "enthusiastic" to "straightforward"
- **Change length**: Specify word counts or duration for outputs (e.g., "under 200 words")
- **Focus on specifics**: Add industry details, product names, or company context
- **Combine prompts**: Use discovery questions first, then feed answers into a proposal prompt
- **Create variations**: Save custom versions of prompts with your preferred tweaks
