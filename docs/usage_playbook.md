# Usage Playbook: Outreach → Discovery → Scope → Proposal → Delivery → Retrospective

This playbook walks through a full client lifecycle inside the AI Prompts Library. Each stage lists the prompt(s) that keep your process fast and consistent, plus how to use them.

## 1. Outreach
- **Goal:** Warm up new leads with personal, context-aware openers.
- **Prompts:**
  - `en/outreach_first_line.txt` + `es/outreach_first_line.txt`
  - `en/lead_research_to_email_intro.txt` + `es/lead_research_to_email_intro.txt`
- **How to use:** Drop the research snippets into the VARIABLES to draft the opening line for LinkedIn or cold email. This primes the conversation before pitching automation or chatbot services.

## 2. Discovery
- **Goal:** Uncover workflows, tools, and success criteria before suggesting solutions.
- **Prompts:**
  - `en/automation_discovery_questions.txt` / `es/automation_discovery_questions.txt`
  - `en/chatbot_discovery_questions.txt` / `es/chatbot_discovery_questions.txt`
  - `en/automation_discovery_call.txt` / `es/automation_discovery_call.txt`
  - `en/chatbot_discovery_call.txt` / `es/chatbot_discovery_call.txt`
- **How to use:** Start with the question lists to prep intake forms, then run live calls using the call-agenda prompts so every meeting ends with artifacts, success metrics, and agreed next steps.

## 3. Scope
- **Goal:** Turn raw notes into a structured definition of work.
- **Prompt:** `en/discovery_notes_to_scope.txt` / `es/discovery_notes_to_scope.txt`
- **How to use:** Paste your discovery notes, constraints, and solution menu to produce a scope section with goals, phased deliverables, timeline, and risks. Share it internally or paste directly into a proposal deck.

## 4. Proposal
- **Goal:** Craft a tailored Upwork or direct proposal quickly.
- **Prompts:**
  - `en/upwork_proposal_general.txt` / `es/upwork_proposal_general.txt`
  - `en/upwork_job_response_helper.txt` / `es/upwork_job_response_helper.txt`
  - `en/client_fit_red_flag_analyzer.txt` / `es/client_fit_red_flag_analyzer.txt`
- **How to use:** Run the fit analyzer first to confirm go/no-go. Use the general proposal prompt for longer bids and the response helper for fast replies or invites. Both ensure empathy, proof, and clear CTAs.

## 5. Delivery
- **Goal:** Keep execution aligned with tone, data, and automation workflows.
- **Prompts:**
  - `en/chatbot_tone.md` / `es/chatbot_tone.md` – define brand-consistent assistant voice.
  - `en/podcast_to_blog.txt` / `es/podcast_to_blog.txt` – example of multi-output automation during fulfillment.
  - (Pair with your project-specific instructions or SOPs.)
- **How to use:** Feed the tone guide into your assistant build or QA reviews, and use delivery prompts (like podcast-to-blog) when producing content outputs from source material.

## 6. Retrospective
- **Goal:** Capture outcomes, quotes, and next steps once the project wraps.
- **Prompt:** `en/post_project_retrospective.txt` / `es/post_project_retrospective.txt`
- **How to use:** After final delivery, replace the placeholders with metrics, quotes, and future recommendations. Send the recap to clients, convert it into a testimonial, or reuse it in future proposals.

## 7. Continuous Upwork Optimization
- **Goal:** Refresh positioning and triage new opportunities before jumping back into the cycle.
- **Prompts:**
  - `en/upwork_profile_rewriter.txt` / `es/upwork_profile_rewriter.txt`
  - `en/upwork_job_triage_plan.txt` / `es/upwork_job_triage_plan.txt`
  - Chain with `en/upwork_job_response_helper.txt` / `es/upwork_job_response_helper.txt` and `en/discovery_notes_to_scope.txt` / `es/discovery_notes_to_scope.txt`
- **How to use:**
  1. Run the profile rewriter whenever you pivot niches (automation → chatbots → AI security) so your public profile matches current offers.
  2. Collect 3–5 promising job posts, drop them into the job triage prompt with your available hours, and let it pick the best targets plus proposal/Loom/follow-up steps.
  3. For each "Yes" job, immediately paste the plan into the Job Response Helper to draft the message, then move accepted calls into Discovery Notes → Scope. This keeps your outreach, proposals, and scoping in one coherent loop.
