## Brand Voice Principles

### Core Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Do | Don't |
|-----------|-------------|-----|-------|
| **Modern** | Contemporary, forward-thinking, tech-aware | Use present tense, active voice | Use dated references or clichés |
| **Luxurious** | Elevated, refined, exclusive | Imply scarcity and quality | Over-explain or justify value |
| **Concise** | Minimal, intentional, impactful | Every word earns its place | Use filler words or redundancy |

### Voice Characteristics

**Confidence without arrogance**
Speak with quiet authority. Let quality speak for itself.

**Exclusivity without elitism**
Create desire through selectivity, not condescension.

**Warmth without over-familiarity**
Personable yet polished. Approachable yet aspirational.

### Writing Rules

1. **Lead with the benefit, not the feature**
2. **Use whitespace as a design element**
3. **Prefer periods over exclamation marks**
4. **Avoid superlatives—let context imply excellence**
5. **Write at an 8th-grade reading level with elevated vocabulary**

### Word Palette

**Use freely:**
- Curated, refined, elevated, intentional
- Seamless, effortless, timeless
- Crafted, designed, considered
- Access, invitation, collection

**Use sparingly:**
- Exclusive, luxury, premium (show, don't tell)
- Amazing, incredible, best (let others say it)

**Avoid:**
- Cheap, discount, deal, bargain
- ASAP, FOMO, limited time only
- Hey there, Hi friend, What's up

### 3. Teaser Copy

#### Pre-Launch Teaser (Short)

```
Something refined is coming.

{launch_date}.
```

#### Pre-Launch Teaser (Medium)

```
We've spent months perfecting every detail.

Now we're ready to share it with a select few.

{product_name} arrives {launch_date}.
```

#### Pre-Launch Teaser (Long)

```
Great things take time.

We could have rushed. We chose not to.

Every element has been considered, tested, and refined until it felt right.

{product_name} launches {launch_date}.

Join the waitlist for priority access.
```

#### Product Teaser

```
Not everything needs to shout to be heard.

{product_name} speaks through craftsmanship,
attention, and an unwavering commitment to quality.

This is what considered design looks like.
```

#### Scarcity Teaser

```
We keep our numbers intentionally small.

This allows us to maintain the standard
you—and we—expect.

When a space opens, we'll let you know.
```

## Quick Reference: Tone Adjustments

| Scenario | Tone Shift | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Urgency needed** | Stay calm, imply scarcity | "Spaces are limited." not "HURRY!" |
| **Apologizing** | Own it, stay brief | "We fell short. Here's how we're making it right." |
| **Celebrating** | Understated pride | "We're pleased to share..." not "We're SO excited!!!" |
| **Pricing** | Confident, no justification | State the price. Period. |

---

## Example Usage

**Input Variables:**
```

## Implementation Notes

### Email Platform Settings
- **Preheader text:** Keep under 40 characters, mirror subject tone
- **From name:** Use brand name only, no "Team" or "Support"
- **Reply-to:** Use a real, monitored address

### Typography Recommendations
- Use generous line spacing (1.6–1.8)
- Prefer sentence case over title case
- Allow copy to breathe with whitespace

### A/B Testing Priorities
1. Subject line length (short vs. medium)
2. CTA button text
3. Email length (minimal vs. full)
