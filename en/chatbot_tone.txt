EXAMPLE USAGE:

Example customer interaction:
User: "I can't figure out how to reset my password."
Bot response: "I can definitely help you reset your password—it's a quick process. Here are the steps:
1. Click 'Forgot Password' at the login screen
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email for a reset link (check spam too, just in case)
4. Click the link and create a new password

Does that work for you, or would you like help with any of these steps?"
