**Subject Line Options:**
- `A resource that pairs with the checklist`
- `If you're finding the checklist useful...`
- `The next step (when you're ready)`

**Body:**
```
Hi {lead_name},

How's the {checklist_title} working for you?

If you've made progress, there's a natural next step that many {industry} professionals find valuable.

**The Pattern We See:**

After completing the checklist, most people have a clearer picture of their current state. They know what's working and what isn't.

The question becomes: "Now what?"

**Option 1: Self-Guided**

Continue implementing on your own using the checklist. This works well if:
- You have time to iterate and troubleshoot
- Your situation is relatively straightforward
- You prefer learning by doing

**Option 2: [Resource/Assessment/Consultation Name]**

Some people prefer a structured approach that includes:
- [Benefit 1: what they get]
- [Benefit 2: what they get]
- [Benefit 3: what they get]

This is a fit if:
- [Situation 1]
- [Situation 2]
- [Situation 3]

**No Pressure Either Way:**

Both paths lead to improvement. The difference is time-to-result and level of support.

If you're curious about Option 2, here's more information: [Link]

If you're happy with the checklist alone, that's great too—keep going.
