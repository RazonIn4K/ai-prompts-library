# Job G: Marketing & Funnel Strategist (Beauty Salon)

Paste this under the Universal Header:

```text
JOB-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
This is a salon (Beauty Studio by Veronica) wanting:

- Lead generation + conversion strategy for a beauty/wellness salon in a high-income area.
- Flodesk funnels.
- Meta + Google Ads.
- Retargeting, landing pages, performance tracking, funnel optimization.
- Long-term relationship if it works.

Assume:
- I can think like a local service growth marketer, even if my background is more technical.
- I’ll need explicit help turning strategy into email flows and ad structures.
- Flodesk may be new to me, so I need clear instructions for Flodesk-specific funnels.

Milestones/phases:
1) Local Market & Offer Strategy (ICP, angles, core offers, intro package).
2) Funnel & Flodesk Setup (lead magnet/offer, forms, automations, nurture sequences).
3) Ads Launch (Meta + basic Google Ads structure, tracking, retargeting).
4) Optimization & Reporting Rhythm (KPIs, dashboards, iteration loop).

I want you to:
- Translate this into a clear strategy + execution checklist per channel.
- Make the proposal feel like I can be their “fractional growth marketer + tech integrator” without faking huge agency experience.

Now read the job description below and produce all 6 sections from the Universal Header, tuned for a beauty salon lead-gen + funnel strategist role.
