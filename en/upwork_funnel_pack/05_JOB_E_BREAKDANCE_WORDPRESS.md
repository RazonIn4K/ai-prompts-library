JOB-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
This is a mid-term engagement:

- Tools: Breakdance builder on WordPress (or similar), info products / course funnels.
- Responsibilities:
  - Build high-converting landing pages for lead magnets, funnels, course sales.
  - Optimize hero layout, headlines, social proof, CTAs.
  - Set up split tests.
  - Recommend funnel improvements based on data.

When you build the plan, assume:
- I can comfortably work in WordPress and can learn Breakdance quickly with docs.
- I can help set up tracking (GA4, Meta Pixel, etc.) with guidance.
- Engagement is hourly, but my proposal should still pitch a phased plan.

Milestones/phases to bias toward:
1) Discovery + Funnel Map (understand offers, audiences, KPIs).
2) First Landing Page Build (MVP high-converting page, ready-to-run).
3) A/B Test Setup + Optimization Loop (headline tests, hero variations, etc.).
4) Systematized Funnel Template Library (reusable sections/templates).

I want you to give me:
- A concrete file structure for design docs (Figma links, copy docs) and test logs.
- A strong proposal positioning me as a systems-focused, data-driven builder, not just a pretty-page designer.
