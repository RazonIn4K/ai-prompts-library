JOB-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
This job is an urgent Systeme.io funnel setup with:

- Custom domain connection to Systeme.io
- PayPal integration on offer pages + order forms
- Check + fix funnel flow:
  Sales Page → Opt-in → Thank You → Upsells → Order Form → Confirmation → Booking Page
- Page speed + light optimization
- Final polish for a real-estate award demo TOMORROW
- Timebox: 2–3 hours from start.

When designing milestones, focus on speed + clear checkpoints, e.g.:
1) Domain + SSL + live funnel
2) PayPal wired + test payment verified
3) Funnel flow QA + speed + mobile polish

I will follow your checklist step-by-step and can use Playwright or manual testing to validate links and flows. Assume I can access Systeme.io settings, DNS panel for the domain, and PayPal account.

Now read the job description below and produce all 6 sections from the Universal Header, tuned for this Systeme.io + PayPal + domain setup.
