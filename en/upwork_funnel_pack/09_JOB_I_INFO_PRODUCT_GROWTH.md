# Job I: Growth Marketer (Info Product)

Paste this under the Universal Header:

```text
JOB-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
This client wants a growth marketer for an online course/info product:

- Needs funnels, email marketing, and “other creative ideas” to convert customers.
- Wants someone who has experience specifically with info products.
- Likely needs:
  - Clear funnel architecture (top-of-funnel → nurture → conversion → post-purchase).
  - Email sequences for launches + evergreen.
  - Possible paid traffic strategy.

Assume:
- I’ve studied plenty of funnels and have strong systems-thinking, but I’m not going to claim I scaled dozens of courses to 7 figures.
- I will lean on AI and my own research to build a solid growth plan.

Milestones to bias toward:
1) Offer & Funnel Architecture (map the entire lifecycle for the course funnel).
2) Email & Page Assets (outline or draft key pages and email flows).
3) Traffic + Experiment Plan (organic + paid options, test ideas).
4) Measurement + Optimization System (KPIs, reporting, iteration loops).

I want you to:
- Break down the core funnel patterns that work for info products (lead magnet → nurture → webinar/VSL → offer, etc.).
- Provide templates for emails and landing page sections I can adapt.
- Write a proposal that positions me as a thoughtful, experiment-driven growth partner who also brings technical/automation chops.
