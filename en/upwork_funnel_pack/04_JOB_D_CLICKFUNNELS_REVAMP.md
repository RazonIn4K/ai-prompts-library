JOB-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
This is a ClickFunnels revamp job for a local service business (gutter company):

- Current CF site isn’t converting.
- Goal: higher conversions (quote requests, calls, form fills).
- Client wants someone with strong understanding of sales funnels + landing page optimization.
- Likely needs:
  - Clarified offer & USP.
  - Stronger hero section, social proof, and CTAs.
  - Simple multi-step funnel (lead magnet or straight quote funnel).

You know I already have ClickFunnels experience AND have been working on a ClickFunnels survey funnel with Playwright tests and survey routing.

Milestones to bias toward:
1) Funnel Audit + Strategy (map current funnel, identify quick wins).
2) Wireframed Revamp (new page structure + copy recommendations inside ClickFunnels).
3) Implementation + QA (publish updated pages, form + tracking checks).

I want you to be specific with CF implementations (sections, rows, elements, split-tests ideas) and a test checklist for forms, thank you pages, and mobile responsiveness.

Now read the job description below and produce all 6 sections from the Universal Header, tuned for a ClickFunnels local service conversion revamp.
