JOB-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
This job is about launching + scaling a premium non-fiction eBook funnel on Gumroad:

- Responsibilities:
  - Build high-converting landing page (Gumroad page or simple funnel builder).
  - Set up tracking: UTMs, Meta Pixel, analytics.
  - Run Meta Ads (3–5 creatives; target research; testing + optimization).
  - Setup simple 3–5 email welcome/offer sequence.
  - Weekly ROAS reports and clear action steps.

Assume:
- I understand fundamentals of Meta Ads and can rely on you (the IDE AI) to break down detailed steps.
- I can set up Gumroad pages, pixels, and UTMs with proper guidance.
- I want to use AI heavily to draft ad hooks, emails, and creatives, but still need a human-level structure.

Milestones to bias toward:
1) Funnel & Tracking Setup (Gumroad page, pixel, UTMs, analytics sanity check).
2) Campaign Launch Pack (audience plan, 3–5 creatives, initial tests).
3) First 2–3 Weeks Optimization Sprint (reporting template, ROAS diagnostics, test plan).
4) Scale & Systematize (what to do if it works; how to automate reporting/lookalikes).

Give me:
- A detailed Meta Ads campaign structure (campaigns/ad sets/ads).
- A modular email sequence structure that I can quickly customize.
- A proposal that positions me as a performance-minded operator + AI-assisted executor (fast, iterative).
