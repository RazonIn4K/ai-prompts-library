JOB-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
This is a heavier UX/CRO job for a 45+ year interiors/window furnishings company (Quicksew), with 3 segments:

- Health & Aged Care
- Commercial projects
- Residential homeowners

Scope:
- Redesign quicksew.com.au to create clear funnels for those 3 verticals.
- Increase qualified leads (consults, quotes, catalogue downloads).
- Support HubSpot lead capture + paid traffic with high-converting landing pages.
- Deliverables: UX/CRO strategy doc, wireframes (desktop + mobile), final UI designs (Figma, etc.), tracking plan (GA4 + GTM).

Assume:
- I can use Figma and design clean, conversion-focused UIs with AI help.
- I can design funnels even if I’m not a “pure” visual designer.
- I understand lead-gen websites enough to plan forms, CTAs, and tracking.

Milestones to bias toward:
1) Research + UX/CRO Strategy (audience analysis, funnel gaps, strategy doc).
2) Wireframes (homepage triage + 3 vertical pages, desktop + mobile).
3) UI Designs + Style Guide (Figma components, polished layouts).
4) Tracking & HubSpot/GA4/GTM Plan (forms, events, goals).

I want you to:
- Give me a detailed breakdown of each page’s sections and messaging for each vertical.
- Propose a simple but solid Figma component system.
- Give me a tracking plan that maps CTAs and forms to GA4/GTM events + HubSpot objects.

Now read the job description below and produce all 6 sections from the Universal Header, tuned for Quicksew’s multi-vertical UX/CRO redesign project.
