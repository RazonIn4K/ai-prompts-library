# Job C: CRO / Landing Page (Organic Dropshipping)

Paste this under the Universal Header:

```text
JOB-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
This client has:
- An organic dropshipping brand with ~$600K generated organically.
- A current landing page ("lander") that's rough and not converting.
- They want:
  - Layout + flow that feels logical and high-converting.
  - Setup of key flows (abandoned checkout, browse abandon, post-purchase, etc.).
  - Focus on actual conversion improvements, not just "prettier design".

When you design milestones, think in CRO terms:
1) CRO Audit + Strategy (recording current page, mapping funnel, finding bottlenecks).
2) Landing Page Revamp (copy/structure suggestions, wireframe-level structure they or their dev can implement).
3) Flow Setup (abandoned checkout, browse abandon, post-purchase flows; likely via email/ESP + store platform).
4) Testing + Iteration Plan.

Keep in mind:
- I can use tools like Hotjar-type suggestions, GA, or platform analytics conceptually, even if I don't have actual access yet.
- I want you to give me a very concrete "change this section to X" type guide I can implement or hand to a dev.

Now read the job description below and produce all 6 sections from the Universal Header, tuned for CRO + flow setup on an existing ecom lander.
