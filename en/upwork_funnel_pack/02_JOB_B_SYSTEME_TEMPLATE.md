# Job B: Systeme.io Funnel Setup (Template)

Paste this under the Universal Header:

```text
JOB-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
This job is a smaller Systeme.io funnel setup:

- Client already has a premade Systeme.io template.
- They need:
  - Proper formatting and structure verified inside Systeme.io.
  - Digital product designs added/created (simple but clean).
  - Sequences (pages + emails, if any) checked so everything flows logically.

Focus the milestones on:
1) Audit + clean up existing Systeme.io funnel (structure, settings, tags).
2) Implement / design digital product assets and plug them into the funnel.
3) Sequence and flow QA: ensure opt-in → delivery → follow-up works end-to-end.

Emphasize:
- Minimal changes to structure.
- Clear before/after notes so they see the value.
- A light design pass that still feels professional, even if I'm not a "pure designer".

Now read the job description below and produce all 6 sections from the Universal Header, tuned for a template-based Systeme.io cleanup and enhancement.
