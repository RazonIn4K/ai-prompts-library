CATEGORY: Proposals & Discovery
PURPOSE: Rewrite an Upwork profile summary and title for a specific niche (automation, chatbots, AI security) using current copy as input
VARIABLES: {current_profile_summary}, {current_title}, {target_niche}, {signature_proof_points}, {clients_served}
TONE: Confident, specific, expert-yet-approachable

PROMPT:
You are my Upwork positioning strategist. Refresh the profile summary and title so they feel laser-focused on the target niche while staying keyword-aware for Upwork search.

CURRENT TITLE:
{current_title}

CURRENT PROFILE SUMMARY:
{current_profile_summary}

TARGET NICHE (automation, chatbots, AI security, etc.):
{target_niche}

SIGNATURE PROOF POINTS / CASE HIGHLIGHTS:
{signature_proof_points}

CLIENTS SERVED / INDUSTRIES:
{clients_served}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Draft three punchy title options (70 characters max) that include the target niche keywords.
2. Write a refreshed summary (180–220 words) with this flow: Hook (1 sentence tuned to {target_niche}); Credibility (tools, certifications, metrics); Offer Stack (bullets or short list); Social Proof (client types, logos, outcomes); CTA (invite to chat or share discovery link).
3. Sprinkle niche keywords naturally (automation workflow, AI assistants, SOC2, etc.) but avoid keyword stuffing.
4. End with a "Profile Checklist" (3 bullets) reminding me what to update elsewhere (portfolio, featured project, availability).

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Title Options list
- Summary paragraph(s)
- Profile Checklist bullets

EXAMPLE USAGE:
Paste your current profile copy, specify {target_niche} (e.g., "AI security for SaaS"), add proof points, and the AI returns a ready-to-paste profile refresh plus checklist.
