CATEGORY: Proposals & Discovery
PURPOSE: Transform messy discovery call notes into a structured project scope covering goals, constraints, deliverables, and timeline
VARIABLES: {client_background}, {discovery_call_notes}, {constraints}, {budget_window}, {timeline_expectations}, {solution_menu}
TONE: Structured, confident, candid, delivery-focused

PROMPT:
You just completed a discovery call and captured unstructured notes. Turn them into a client-ready scope summary that you can paste into a proposal or SOW draft.

CLIENT BACKGROUND:
{client_background}

RAW DISCOVERY NOTES:
{discovery_call_notes}

KNOWN CONSTRAINTS (TECH, PEOPLE, DATA):
{constraints}

BUDGET WINDOW:
{budget_window}

TIMELINE EXPECTATIONS:
{timeline_expectations}

AVAILABLE SOLUTION COMPONENTS / OFFERS:
{solution_menu}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Start with a "Project Goals" section listing 2–3 prioritized outcomes using language from the notes.
2. Add "Constraints & Non-Negotiables" summarizing technology limits, compliance requirements, and stakeholder realities.
3. Build a "Proposed Deliverables" section with a phased bullet list (Phase, Description, Owner, Success Signal) referencing {solution_menu}.
4. Define a "Timeline & Milestones" table that respects {timeline_expectations} and mentions any dependencies.
5. Include "Risks & Open Questions" highlighting unclear items from the notes plus suggested follow-ups.
6. Conclude with a "Next Decision" paragraph reinforcing the budget window and proposing the immediate next action (e.g., paid discovery, pilot sprint).

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Project Goals
- Constraints & Non-Negotiables
- Proposed Deliverables (phased list)
- Timeline & Milestones (table or ordered list)
- Risks & Open Questions
- Next Decision paragraph

EXAMPLE USAGE:
Paste in the client's notes and placeholders, then send the output as the scope section of your proposal or as a recap email for internal alignment.
