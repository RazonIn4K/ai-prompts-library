## 1. Five-Email Nurture Sequence

### Email 1: Welcome + Positioning (Immediately After Opt-In)

**Subject Lines (Pick One):**
- `{first_name}, let's talk about your real estate future`
- `Here's why most agents stay stuck (and how to fix it)`
- `Welcome — your path to {success_story_result} starts now`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

Welcome. You just made a decision that puts you ahead of 90% of agents who will never take action.

I'm {mentor_name}, and I've spent {mentor_credential} helping agents just like you go from struggling to thriving.

Here's what I've learned:

The difference between agents who close 3 deals a year and those who close 30 isn't luck. It isn't market conditions. It isn't even experience.

It's systems. Strategy. And the willingness to stop doing what doesn't work.

Over the next few days, I'm going to share exactly what separates top producers from everyone else — and how you can make that shift faster than you think.

But first, let me ask you something:

**What would change in your life if you doubled your closings in the next 12 months?**

Really think about it. Because that's not just possible — I've seen it happen hundreds of times.

Keep an eye on your inbox. Tomorrow, I'm sharing the #1 mistake that keeps most agents broke.

Talk soon,
{mentor_name}

P.S. — If you're ready to stop waiting and start building, {bootcamp_name} kicks off {start_date}. Early birds get {bonus} (worth {bonus_value}) free. More details coming soon.
```

---

### Email 2: Pain Point + Credibility (Day 2)

**Subject Lines (Pick One):**
- `The expensive mistake 87% of agents make`
- `{first_name}, are you working hard or working smart?`
- `Why your "hustle" isn't working (the real reason)`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

I'm going to be direct with you.

If you're working 60-hour weeks, chasing every lead, and still struggling to hit your numbers — you're not lazy. You're not unlucky.

You're just using the wrong playbook.

I see it constantly: talented agents burning out because they're doing EVERYTHING except the things that actually close deals.

Here's what top producers do differently:

1. **They focus on high-intent activities** — Not busy work. Not endless social media posting. Activities that put them in front of ready buyers and sellers.

2. **They build systems that work without them** — So they're not starting from zero every single month.

3. **They invest in skills, not just leads** — Because a $10,000 marketing budget means nothing if you can't convert.

When I started, I made every mistake in the book. I spent two years grinding with nothing to show for it.

Then I figured out what actually works.

That's exactly what I teach inside {bootcamp_name} — the same systems I used to {success_story_result}, and the same ones my students use every day.

Tomorrow, I'll share the exact framework that turns cold leads into signed contracts. You'll want to read that one twice.

To your success,
{mentor_name}

P.S. — {bootcamp_name} starts {start_date}. Spots are limited to keep the group small and focused. If you're serious about leveling up, this is your chance.
```

---

### Email 3: Framework/Value (Day 4)

**Subject Lines (Pick One):**
- `The 3-part system that changed everything for me`
- `How to close more deals without more leads`
- `{first_name}, steal this strategy from top producers`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

Today I'm giving you the exact framework I teach to every agent who goes through {bootcamp_name}.

It's called the **Three Pillars of Predictable Income**:

**Pillar 1: Lead Conversion Systems**
Most agents focus on getting MORE leads. That's backwards.

What's the point of 100 leads if you're only closing 2? Inside the bootcamp, I show you how to close 8-12 out of every 100 leads — that alone can double your income without spending another dollar on marketing.

**Pillar 2: Client Acquisition Routines**
The agents who make consistent money aren't winging it. They have daily and weekly routines that generate business on autopilot. I'll give you the exact schedule that works — tested across thousands of agents in every market condition.

**Pillar 3: Leverage & Scale**
Once you're closing consistently, you need systems that let you grow without working more hours. This is where most agents plateau. Inside {bootcamp_name}, I show you how to break through.

Here's the thing, {first_name}:

You can spend the next three years figuring this out on your own. Or you can learn it in {bootcamp_name} and start implementing immediately.

{success_story_name} joined my last cohort struggling to close 2 deals a quarter. Six months later? {success_story_result}.

That transformation is available to you too.

More details on {bootcamp_name} coming tomorrow — including the exclusive bonus for early action-takers.

Talk soon,
{mentor_name}
```

---

### Email 4: Social Proof + Urgency (Day 6)

**Subject Lines (Pick One):**
- `They said I was "lucky" — here's the truth`
- `From 3 deals to {success_story_result} (real story inside)`
- `{first_name}, this is what's possible for you`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

Let me tell you about {success_story_name}.

When they joined {bootcamp_name}, they were:
- Working 60+ hours a week
- Closing maybe 3-4 deals a year
- Ready to quit real estate entirely

Sound familiar?

Six months after implementing what I taught, {success_story_name} {success_story_result}.

But here's what most people don't realize:

{success_story_name} isn't special. They're not smarter. They don't have more connections. They simply learned the right systems and executed.

I've seen this transformation hundreds of times:

✓ The part-time agent who went full-time and replaced her corporate salary in 8 months
✓ The burned-out veteran who finally built a team and took his first real vacation
✓ The brand new agent who closed 14 deals in his first year when the average is 2

**These results aren't accidental.** They come from applying proven systems consistently.

That's what {bootcamp_name} delivers.

Here's what's included:

→ {bootcamp_name} Core Training (12 modules)
→ Weekly Live Coaching Calls
→ Private Community Access
→ Done-For-You Scripts & Templates
→ BONUS: {bonus} (worth {bonus_value}) — FREE for early action-takers

**Investment:** {price} (normally {original_price})

**Start Date:** {start_date}

{first_name}, I'm not here to convince you. I'm here to show you what's possible.

If you're ready to stop struggling and start producing, this is your opportunity.

**[RESERVE YOUR SPOT →]({payment_link})**

Tomorrow, I'll send the final details — and share why waiting might cost you more than you realize.

{mentor_name}
```

### Email 5: Final CTA + Scarcity (Day 7)

**Subject Lines (Pick One):**
- `{first_name}, decision time`
- `Doors close at midnight — what's your move?`
- `Last chance: {bonus} disappears tonight`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

I'll keep this short.

{bootcamp_name} enrollment closes tonight at midnight.

After that:
- The price goes back to {original_price}
- The bonus ({bonus}) is gone
- The next cohort won't start for months

Here's what I want you to consider:

**Where will you be 90 days from now?**

If you do nothing, you'll probably be in the same place — working hard, maybe closing a deal here and there, wondering why it's not easier.

Or...

You could be 90 days into a proven system. You could be closing more deals. You could be building the real estate business you actually want.

{success_story_name} made the same decision you're making right now. So did hundreds of other agents who are now top producers.

**The system works. The question is whether you're ready to commit.**

Here's everything you get:

✓ {bootcamp_name} Complete Training System
✓ Weekly Live Coaching (ask me anything)
✓ Private Community of Motivated Agents
✓ Scripts, Templates, and Checklists
✓ BONUS: {bonus} ({bonus_value} value) — FREE

**Total Investment:** {price}

**Deadline:** Tonight, midnight

**[JOIN {bootcamp_name} NOW →]({payment_link})**

I've given you everything you need to make this decision. Now it's on you.

See you inside,
{mentor_name}

P.S. — If you're on the fence, ask yourself: What's the cost of staying stuck another year? For most agents, it's tens of thousands in lost commissions. {price} is the smallest investment you'll make in your career — if you actually use what you learn.

## 2. Webinar Reminder Sequence

### Webinar Confirmation (Immediately After Registration)

**Subject:** `You're in! Here's your webinar access`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

You're confirmed for the live training:

**"{bootcamp_name} — [Webinar Title]"**

📅 **Date:** {start_date}
🕐 **Time:** {start_time} {timezone}
🔗 **Link:** {webinar_link}

Add this to your calendar now — I'll be sharing strategies you won't find anywhere else.

→ My 3-step system for predictable closings every month
→ How to stop chasing leads and start attracting clients

**This isn't a pitch-fest.** I'm going to give you real tactics you can implement immediately.

Whether you ever work with me or not, you'll leave this training with actionable strategies.

See you there,
{mentor_name}

P.S. — Show up live and I'll share a bonus resource I don't give out anywhere else.
```

---

### Webinar Reminder: 24 Hours Before

**Subject:** `Tomorrow: Your real estate breakthrough starts`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

Quick reminder — we go live tomorrow.

**"{bootcamp_name} — [Webinar Title]"**

📅 {start_date}
🕐 {start_time} {timezone}
🔗 {webinar_link}

I'm going to show you exactly how top-producing agents structure their business for consistent income.

This is the same system that's helped agents go from 5 deals a year to 5 deals a MONTH.

**Set an alarm. Clear your schedule. Be there live.**

I'll also be doing live Q&A at the end — so come with your questions.

See you tomorrow,
{mentor_name}
```

---

### Webinar Reminder: 1 Hour Before

**Subject:** `LIVE in 60 minutes — are you ready?`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

We start in ONE HOUR.

Here's your link (bookmark it now):
**{webinar_link}**

Join a few minutes early to make sure your audio/video works.

Bring a notebook. I'm going to move fast and share tactics that have generated millions in commissions for my students.

See you soon,
{mentor_name}

P.S. — Live attendees get access to an exclusive bonus. Don't miss it.
```

---

### Webinar Reminder: Starting NOW

**Subject:** `WE'RE LIVE — Join now`

**Body:**

```
{first_name}, we're starting!

**JOIN HERE:** {webinar_link}

Don't miss this — I'm revealing strategies I've never shared publicly before.

See you inside,
{mentor_name}
```

---

### Webinar No-Show Follow-Up

**Subject:** `{first_name}, you missed it — here's the replay`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

I noticed you registered but couldn't make the live session.

No problem — life happens.

I saved the replay for you:
**[WATCH THE REPLAY →]({replay_link})**

Fair warning: This replay comes down in 48 hours. After that, it's gone.

During the training, I shared:
→ Why most agents stay stuck (and the simple fix)
→ The 3-pillar system for predictable income
→ How to convert more leads without spending more on marketing
→ A special opportunity for serious agents

Watch it today while it's fresh.

Talk soon,
{mentor_name}

P.S. — At the end of the replay, there's a limited-time offer for {bootcamp_name}. If you're serious about growing your business, don't skip that part.
```

---

### Webinar Replay Expiring

**Subject:** `Replay disappears at midnight`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

Last chance.

The replay of my live training comes down tonight at midnight.

**[WATCH NOW →]({replay_link})**

If you haven't watched it yet, here's what you're missing:
- The exact system top producers use to close consistently
- How to stop the feast-or-famine cycle
- The {bootcamp_name} opportunity (lowest price I've offered)

After midnight, this content is gone and the special offer expires.

Your call,
{mentor_name}
```

---

## 3. Deposit & Purchase Nudges

### Deposit Invitation

**Subject:** `{first_name}, reserve your spot for just {deposit_amount}`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

I get it — {price} is a real investment.

That's why I'm giving you an option:

**Secure your spot in {bootcamp_name} today with just {deposit_amount}.**

Here's how it works:
→ Pay {deposit_amount} now to lock in your seat
→ Get immediate access to the pre-work materials
→ Pay the remaining balance before {start_date}

Your deposit is fully applied to the total — this isn't an extra fee.

Why do I offer this? Because I know the agents who take action are the ones who succeed. I don't want money to be what stops you from changing your business.

**[SECURE YOUR SPOT WITH {deposit_amount} →]({payment_link})**

Spots are limited. Once they're gone, you'll have to wait for the next cohort.

{mentor_name}

P.S. — Deposit holders also get early access to the private community. Start networking with other serious agents before the bootcamp even begins.
```

---

### Cart Abandonment Email #1 (1 Hour After)

**Subject:** `{first_name}, your spot is waiting`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

I noticed you started the checkout for {bootcamp_name} but didn't finish.

No pressure — I just want to make sure nothing went wrong on our end.

If you had a tech issue or question, just reply to this email. I'll help you sort it out.

If you're still thinking it over, I understand. This is a real decision.

Here's what I'll say: The agents who succeed are the ones who stop thinking and start doing. Every day you wait is another day of leaving money on the table.

Your spot is still reserved. The bonus ({bonus}) is still available.

**[COMPLETE YOUR ENROLLMENT →]({payment_link})**

I'd love to have you inside.

{mentor_name}
```

---

### Cart Abandonment Email #2 (24 Hours After)

**Subject:** `Quick question, {first_name}`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

I'll be direct: What's holding you back?

Is it...

**The price?** — I get it. {price} isn't nothing. But let me ask: What's ONE extra deal worth to you? For most markets, that's {price} back 5x, 10x, or more. This pays for itself with your first additional closing.

**The time commitment?** — The bootcamp is designed for working agents. Everything is recorded. You can go at your own pace while still getting live support.

**Not sure if it'll work?** — I could point you to hundreds of success stories. But honestly? The only way to know is to try. That's why I have a satisfaction guarantee.

Whatever it is, I'd rather you just tell me. Hit reply and let me know what's on your mind.

Or if you're ready:
**[JOIN {bootcamp_name} →]({payment_link})**

Either way, I'm here.

{mentor_name}
```

---

### Price Increase Warning

**Subject:** `Price goes up tomorrow, {first_name}`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

Wanted to give you a heads up:

At midnight tomorrow, {bootcamp_name} goes back to full price ({original_price}).

That's a {savings_amount} difference.

Plus, the bonus ({bonus} — worth {bonus_value}) disappears completely.

If you've been on the fence, this is decision time.

**Current price:** {price}
**Price after deadline:** {original_price}
**Bonus available:** Only until tomorrow

I'm not going to keep emailing you about this. After tomorrow, I'll assume you're not ready right now — and that's okay.

But if you ARE ready, don't let this opportunity slip:
**[LOCK IN {price} NOW →]({payment_link})**

{mentor_name}
```

---

### Final Hours Reminder

**Subject:** `{seats_remaining} spots left — closing tonight`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

Two things:

1. Only {seats_remaining} spots remain in this cohort
2. Enrollment closes in a few hours

After tonight:
- Price goes to {original_price}
- {bonus} is no longer available
- You'll wait months for the next opportunity

I've shared everything — the system, the results, the proof. You have all the information you need.

Now you have to decide: Are you going to keep doing what you've been doing? Or are you ready for something different?

**[JOIN {bootcamp_name} BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE →]({payment_link})**

I hope to see you inside.

{mentor_name}

P.S. — {success_story_name} almost didn't join. They told me they "couldn't afford it." Now they've made {success_story_result}. Sometimes the "expensive" choice is actually the cheapest decision you'll ever make.
```

## 4. Post-Signup Onboarding Sequence

### Onboarding Email 1: Welcome & Orientation (Immediately)

**Subject:** `Welcome to {bootcamp_name} — start here`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

You're officially in. Congratulations on making a decision that most agents never will.

Here's exactly what to do next:

**Step 1: Access Your Dashboard**
Log in and explore the training portal. Your courses, bonuses, and resources are waiting:
[ACCESS YOUR DASHBOARD →]({portal_link})

**Step 2: Join the Private Community**
This is where the magic happens. Connect with fellow agents, ask questions, and get support:
[JOIN THE COMMUNITY →]({community_link})

**Step 3: Mark Your Calendar**
Our first live coaching call is:
📅 {first_call_date}
🕐 {first_call_time} {timezone}

**Step 4: Complete the Pre-Work**
In your dashboard, you'll find a "Start Here" module. Complete it before our first call so you hit the ground running.

I'm serious about your success, {first_name}. But I need you to be serious too.

Show up. Do the work. Ask questions when you're stuck.

That's the formula.

Welcome to the team,
{mentor_name}

P.S. — Your bonus ({bonus}) is already in your dashboard under "Bonuses." Make sure to download it.
```

---

### Onboarding Email 2: Community Introduction (Day 1)

**Subject:** `Your first assignment (takes 5 minutes)`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

Quick assignment for you today:

**Introduce yourself in the community.**

Here's why this matters: The agents who engage with the community get 3x better results than those who stay silent. That's not marketing — it's data from tracking hundreds of students.

Go to the community, find the Introductions thread, and share:
1. Your name and market
2. How long you've been in real estate
3. Your #1 goal for this bootcamp

**[POST YOUR INTRODUCTION →]({community_link})**

Takes 5 minutes. Sets the tone for your entire experience.

I'll see you in there.

{mentor_name}

P.S. — When you post, tag me. I personally welcome every new member.
```

---

### Onboarding Email 3: Expectations & Success Path (Day 3)

**Subject:** `How to get 10x ROI from {bootcamp_name}`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

I want to set you up for success, so let me be clear about what separates agents who transform their business from those who don't.

**What DOESN'T work:**
- Watching all the videos but never implementing
- Skipping the live calls because you're "too busy"
- Staying silent in the community and trying to figure everything out alone
- Making excuses instead of making progress

**What DOES work:**
- Completing one module, then implementing before moving to the next
- Attending live calls and asking questions (I'm here to help YOU)
- Engaging daily in the community — even just reading and commenting
- Treating this like the business investment it is

{first_name}, I've done everything I can to create the best training system for real estate agents. But I can't do the work for you.

**Your commitment for this week:**
✓ Finish the "Start Here" module
✓ Post your introduction in the community
✓ Block 2 hours on your calendar for learning each week

Do these three things and you're already ahead of 50% of people who sign up for courses.

Let's make this count.

{mentor_name}
```

---

### Onboarding Email 4: First Live Call Reminder (Day Before First Call)

**Subject:** `TOMORROW: Our first live call — don't miss it`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

Our first live coaching call is tomorrow.

📅 **Date:** {first_call_date}
🕐 **Time:** {first_call_time} {timezone}
🔗 **Link:** (in your dashboard)

This isn't a lecture. It's interactive.

Bring your questions. Bring your challenges. I'll help you work through them in real-time.

Topics we'll cover:
→ Setting up your 90-day action plan
→ The first strategy to implement this week
→ Live Q&A

If you can't make it live, the recording will be in your dashboard within 24 hours. But showing up live is always better — you can ask questions and get real-time feedback.

See you tomorrow,
{mentor_name}
```

---

### Onboarding Email 5: One Week Check-In (Day 7)

**Subject:** `{first_name}, how's your first week going?`

**Body:**

```
{first_name},

It's been one week since you joined {bootcamp_name}.

Let me ask you a few questions:

✓ Have you completed the first module?
✓ Have you attended (or watched) the live coaching call?
✓ Have you introduced yourself in the community?
✓ Have you identified your first action item to implement?

If you answered yes to all four — you're on track. Keep going.

If you haven't — no judgment, but let's fix that TODAY.

The agents who succeed in this program are the ones who stay consistent in weeks 1-3. That's when the habits form. That's when the foundation gets built.

Don't let this become another program you bought but never used.

**What to do right now:**
1. Log into your dashboard
2. Complete the next incomplete module
3. Post a question or win in the community

That's it. One step forward, then another.

I'm here if you need help. Just reply to this email or post in the community.

Let's build something great,
{mentor_name}

P.S. — If something's getting in the way of your progress, tell me. I've heard every excuse and obstacle — and I can probably help you solve it.
```

**Sample Nurture Email 1 Output:**
```
David,

Welcome. You just made a decision that puts you ahead of 90% of agents who will never take action.

I'm Mike Johnson, and I've spent 15 years and 500+ closed deals helping agents just like you go from struggling to thriving.

Here's what I've learned:

The difference between agents who close 3 deals a year and those who close 30 isn't luck. It isn't market conditions. It isn't even experience.

It's systems. Strategy. And the willingness to stop doing what doesn't work.

Over the next few days, I'm going to share exactly what separates top producers from everyone else — and how you can make that shift faster than you think.

But first, let me ask you something:

What would change in your life if you doubled your closings in the next 12 months?

Really think about it. Because that's not just possible — I've seen it happen hundreds of times.

Keep an eye on your inbox. Tomorrow, I'm sharing the #1 mistake that keeps most agents broke.

Talk soon,
Mike Johnson

P.S. — If you're ready to stop waiting and start building, Real Estate Accelerator kicks off February 1, 2025. Early birds get Lead Conversion Scripts Bundle (worth $497) free. More details coming soon.
