# 03: Client Case Study (Before/After)

Paste this under the Universal Header:

```text
SCENARIO: Case study deck highlighting before/after results. Audience = prospects/stakeholders. Goal = earn trust and trigger next-step call.

REQUIRED SECTIONS (10–13 slides):
- Client snapshot: industry, size, region, stack highlights.
- Problem baseline: 2–3 quantified pains + why prior attempts failed.
- Success criteria: the “win” metrics and guardrails.
- Solution overview: what we deployed (modules/integrations/ownership).
- Timeline: start → go-live → steady-state, with key moments.
- Results: before/after metrics (table or bar chart) + 1 quote.
- Process glimpse: how we worked (cadence, QA, change mgmt).
- Risks resolved: 2–3 mitigations that mattered.
- Transferability: where this approach also works (verticals/use cases).
- CTA: light offer (workshop/audit/pilot) + timeframe.

RULES:
- Use anonymized labels if needed; keep metrics realistic.
- Visual cues: before/after chart, mini swimlane for timeline, quote card.
- Presenter notes should include proof sources and talking points on causality (why it worked).
