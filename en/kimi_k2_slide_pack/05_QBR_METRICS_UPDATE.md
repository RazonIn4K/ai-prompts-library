SCENARIO: Quarterly/Monthly business review for stakeholders. Audience = leadership/partners. Goal = align on performance, decisions, and next moves.

REQUIRED SECTIONS (11–15 slides):
- Executive summary: 3 wins, 3 gaps, 3 decisions needed.
- Scorecard: goals vs. actuals (table) + trendlines for 3 core KPIs.
- Highlights: what moved the numbers (experiments, launches, partnerships).
- Customer voice: 2–3 quotes or NPS/CSAT trend.
- Efficiency: unit economics or funnel conversion snapshot.
- Risks/blockers: top 3 with owners + mitigation.
- Roadmap: next 60–90 days with themes and outcomes.
- Resourcing: asks (budget/headcount/tools) with rationale.
- Dependencies: cross-team needs + due dates.
- CTA/decisions: explicit approvals or greenlights needed now.

RULES:
- Visual cues: scorecard table, sparkline charts, simple Gantt/kanban for roadmap.
- Keep numbers readable; call out definitions if non-standard.
- Presenter notes: add “what changed since last review” and “what we’re trying next”.
