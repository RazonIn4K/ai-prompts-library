# Kimi K2 Slide Prompt Pack

Prompts to generate slide-ready outlines in Kimi K2 for common presentation scenarios. Use the universal header, then append the scenario add-on that matches your deck, then paste your source notes (if any).

## How to Use

1. Open your AI chat (Kimi K2, Cursor, etc.).
2. Copy **`00_UNIVERSAL_HEADER.md`** and paste it first.
3. Pick a scenario add-on below, paste it **immediately after** the header in the same chat.
4. Paste any raw notes or source material at the end.
5. Run the prompt. You’ll get a slide-by-slide outline with copy, layout cues, visuals, and presenter notes you can drop into Kimi K2.
