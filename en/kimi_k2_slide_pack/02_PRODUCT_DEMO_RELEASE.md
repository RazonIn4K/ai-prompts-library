# 02: Product Demo + Feature Release

Paste this under the Universal Header:

```text
SCENARIO: Product demo + feature release deck. Audience = prospects/customers + internal enablement. Goal = adoption + upsell.

REQUIRED SECTIONS (11–14 slides):
- Context: what changed and why it matters now.
- Before/After: 2–3 pain points, then new state.
- Feature tour: 3 hero features with mini flows (step 1–3 bullets each).
- Live demo guide: call out what to click/say + expected “wow” moments.
- Architecture at a glance: simple diagram showing integrations.
- Security/scale note: 2–3 bullets on reliability/perf.
- Rollout & timeline: GA date, pilots, beta slots.
- Migration/enablement checklist: data, permissions, training, success owner.
- Pricing/packaging: where this sits (plan matrix), add-ons, promos.
- Proof: early results/quotes or simulated metrics if pre-launch.
- CTA: book a pilot, enable the toggle, or start trial.

RULES:
- Titles stay crisp; bullets are task-like, not marketing fluff.
- Visual cues: toggle animation, 3-step flow graphics, simple matrix for pricing, timeline bars.
- Include presenter notes for demo pacing and fallback if something fails.
