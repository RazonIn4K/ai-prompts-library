CATEGORY: Discovery
PURPOSE: Strategic questions to uncover workflows, pain points, tools, and priorities for automation projects
VARIABLES: None (reference guide)
TONE: Consultative, open-ended, discovery-focused

PROMPT:
Use these discovery questions before proposing any automation solution. They help you understand a prospect's current processes, pain points, tools, and business priorities to ensure alignment with their actual needs.

CURRENT WORKFLOWS & PROCESSES:
1. What are your top 3 most time-consuming tasks or processes in your business right now?
2. Walk me through one of those workflows—from start to finish. How many people are involved and what tools do you use?
3. Which of these processes are mostly manual vs. partially automated?
4. Do you have any documented SOPs (standard operating procedures) for these workflows?

PAIN POINTS & BOTTLENECKS:
5. Where do you lose the most time in each process?
6. Are there any error-prone steps where mistakes happen frequently?
7. Where do you have data silos—information stuck in one tool that needs to move to another?
8. What's the cost (in time or money) of your current manual process?

TOOLS & SYSTEMS:
9. What tools are you currently using? (CRM, email, project management, databases, etc.)
10. Are these tools already connected, or do you manually move data between them?
11. What's your technical comfort level? Can your team handle slight changes to workflows?
12. Do you have an IT team or is tech support outsourced?

GOALS & PRIORITIES:
13. If you could automate one thing tomorrow, what would have the biggest impact?
14. How quickly do you need results implemented?
15. What's your budget range for this automation project?
16. Who else needs to approve this decision, and what are their main concerns?

EXAMPLE USAGE:
Use these questions during a discovery call or email questionnaire before writing your proposal. Notes from these questions will inform your solution design and ensure you're addressing real needs, not just technical possibilities.
