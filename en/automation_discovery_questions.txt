Use these discovery questions to understand a prospect's current workflows, pain points, and tools before proposing automation solutions.

CURRENT WORKFLOWS & PROCESSES:
1. What are your top 3 most time-consuming tasks or processes in your business right now?
2. Walk me through one of those workflows—from start to finish. How many people are involved and what tools do you use?
3. Which of these processes are mostly manual vs. partially automated?
4. Do you have any documented SOPs (standard operating procedures) for these workflows?

PAIN POINTS & BOTTLENECKS:
5. Where do you lose the most time in each process?
6. Are there any error-prone steps where mistakes happen frequently?
7. Where do you have data silos—information stuck in one tool that needs to move to another?
8. What's the cost (in time or money) of your current manual process?

TOOLS & SYSTEMS:
9. What tools are you currently using? (CRM, email, project management, databases, etc.)
10. Are these tools already connected, or do you manually move data between them?
11. What's your technical comfort level? Can your team handle slight changes to workflows?
12. Do you have an IT team or is tech support outsourced?

GOALS & PRIORITIES:
13. If you could automate one thing tomorrow, what would have the biggest impact?
14. How quickly do you need results implemented?
15. What's your budget range for this automation project?
16. Who else needs to approve this decision, and what are their main concerns?
