VARIABLES: {week_range}, {wins}, {blockers}, {pipeline_updates}, {upwork_stats}, {content_metrics}, {code_progress}, {energy_level}
TONE: Pragmatic, encouraging, accountability-focused

PROMPT:
You’re running a solo AI services practice across Upwork gigs, High Encode content, and code automation work. Summarize the week and outline the next moves.

WEEK RANGE:

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Provide a "Snapshot" section (3 bullets) summarizing how the week went overall.
2. Create three sub-sections: "Upwork Focus", "Content / High Encode", "Code & Delivery". For each, include: current status, blocker callouts, and 2–3 concrete actions for the coming week.
3. Add a "Pipeline Watchlist" table listing Opportunity | Stage | Next Step | Owner.
4. Close with a "Personal Ops" paragraph that references {energy_level} and suggests one routine or habit adjustment.
