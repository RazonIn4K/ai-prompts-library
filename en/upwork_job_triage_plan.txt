CATEGORY: Proposals & Discovery
PURPOSE: Evaluate multiple Upwork jobs at once, decide which to pursue, and outline a quick proposal plan per pick
VARIABLES: {jobs_list}, {available_time_hours}, {current_pipeline_pressure}, {proof_assets}, {followup_capacity}
TONE: Prioritized, decisive, action-oriented

PROMPT:
You have limited time today. Review the job options below, score them, and recommend a plan of attack for proposals, Looms, and follow-ups.

JOBS (3–5 entries; include link + summary + budget + timeline):
{jobs_list}

AVAILABLE TIME (hours):
{available_time_hours}

PIPELINE PRESSURE / REVENUE NEEDS:
{current_pipeline_pressure}

PROOF ASSETS ON HAND (case studies, Looms, automations):
{proof_assets}

FOLLOW-UP CAPACITY (days you can nudge):
{followup_capacity}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Build a table "Job Triage" with columns Job | Fit Score (1–5) | Est. Effort | Win Rationale.
2. Recommend which jobs to pursue (Yes/Maybe/Pass) and justify in 1 sentence each.
3. For each "Yes" job, outline a mini plan: Proposal angle (30 words), Loom hook idea, follow-up timing referencing {followup_capacity}, and any dependencies (e.g., need extra research).
4. Ensure total effort respects {available_time_hours}; call out if not feasible and suggest deferrals.
5. Close with a "Focus Order" list (1,2,3) and a quick reminder of assets to reuse from {proof_assets}.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Job Triage table
- Recommendation bullets
- Mini Plans (per Yes job)
- Focus Order list

EXAMPLE USAGE:
Paste the 3–5 job links/descriptions, specify how many hours you can spend today, and the model returns a prioritized plan so you can execute proposals efficiently.
